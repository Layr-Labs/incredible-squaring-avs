## Relevant notes
- Make sure go version is 1.21.0 at least
- Add jq package
- Add abigen for go binding generation (install geth https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth)
- Deploy eigenlayer and avs on Goreli instead of devnet. Goal is to have chainlink data feed on goreli loaded into anvil as well
