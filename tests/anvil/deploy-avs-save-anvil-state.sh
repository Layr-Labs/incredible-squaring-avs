# otherwise the indexRegistry has a quorumUpdate at a high block number, and when we restart a clean anvil (without genesis.json) file
# it starts at block 0, and so calling getOperatorListAtBlockNumber reverts because it thinks there are no quorums registered at block 0
# EDIT: this doesn't actually work... since we can't both load a state and a genesis.json file... see https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/6679
